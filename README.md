# CLONE THIS REPOSITORY

This is a base repository to clone to pull the bast-practices Ops has discovered while trying to build Chef cookbooks.

After running `bundle install`, editing the Berksfile and metadata.rb with the correct dependencies, and running `berks install`, you should have all of the necessary tools to run the tests. The tests are run via:

```
bundle exec strainer test
```

The following part of this README is for you to fill out -- and to remove this section.
